# Feature Time Estimation

Invoke the time-estimation skill to get realistic development time estimates with AI efficiency analysis.

## Workflow
1. Understand feature scope and technology stack
2. Break down into component tasks with dependencies
3. Calculate three-point estimates (optimistic/realistic/pessimistic)
4. Compare manual vs AI-assisted development time
5. Apply AI efficiency factors by task type (boilerplate: 60-80%, business logic: 30-50%, algorithms: 10-30%)

## Output
Summary with manual vs AI-assisted times, time savings percentage, detailed task breakdown, and assumptions.
