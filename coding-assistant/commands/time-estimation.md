# Feature Time Estimation

Invoke the time-estimation skill to get realistic development time estimates with AI efficiency analysis.

You are being asked to estimate development time for a feature. Follow the time-estimation skill workflow:

1. **Understand the Request**
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - Determine if it's a new or existing project
   - Identify the technology stack
   - Understand feature scope

2. **Break Down the Feature**
   - Identify all component tasks
   - List technical requirements (frontend, backend, database, API, testing)
   - Map dependencies between tasks
   - Analyze complexity (simple/medium/complex)

3. **Calculate Estimates**
   - Provide **three-point estimates** (optimistic/realistic/pessimistic)
   - Calculate **manual development time** (traditional without AI)
   - Calculate **AI-assisted development time** (using AI tools effectively)
   - Show **time savings** (percentage and absolute hours)

4. **Apply AI Efficiency Factors**
   - **High savings (60-80%)**: Boilerplate, CRUD, tests, documentation
   - **Moderate savings (30-50%)**: Business logic, debugging, API integration
   - **Limited savings (10-30%)**: Algorithms, architecture, performance tuning
   - **Minimal savings (0-10%)**: Meetings, code reviews, production debugging

5. **Present Breakdown**
   - Detailed task-by-task estimates
   - Clear assumptions (experience level, tech stack)
   - Notes and considerations
   - Realistic recommended estimate

**Output Format**:
- Summary with manual vs AI-assisted times
- Time savings calculation
- Detailed breakdown by task category
- Assumptions and notes
- References to similar features

If the request is vague, ask for clarification about:
- Is this a new feature or addition to existing code?
- What's the technology stack?
- What's the developer's experience level?
- Are there any specific constraints or requirements?
