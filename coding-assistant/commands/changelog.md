# Changelog Generator

Invoke the changelog-generator skill to create user-facing changelogs from git commit history.

## Workflow
1. Analyze git history for specified time/version range
2. Categorize changes: New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, Breaking Changes, Security
3. Transform technical commits into user-friendly descriptions
4. Format as structured markdown with clear categories
5. Filter out internal/developer-only changes

## Output
Polished changelog with categorized user-facing changes, focusing on benefits and impact rather than implementation details.
